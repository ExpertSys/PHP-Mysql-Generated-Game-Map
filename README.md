# PHP-Mysql-Generated-Game-Map
This is the code I created while developing my game "Era Heroes".  It's used to generate a map in PHP and then store an active connection to the database in which I can auto update the players coordinates on the game map.

I also have a function which allows the players who are on the same grid / coordinates to challenge eachother in a battle.  The full code for the battle is not provided but it's available from within my game.

# Notes
Using PHP to store the map, and provide the queries wasn't the best idea but I knew that from the start.  This project along with "Era Heroes" was more of a testing experience to see how the game would run with vanilla PHP and Ajax.

If I were to remake this, I would use Node.js + Mysql or MongoDB.
